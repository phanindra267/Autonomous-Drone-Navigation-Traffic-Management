# Autonomous-Drone-Navigation-Traffic-Management
This project integrates AI, robotics, and reinforcement learning (RL) to create an autonomous drone system for urban navigation and traffic management. The drone uses computer vision to detect obstacles and optimize traffic flow in a simulated smart city. Ideal for smart city research and robotics AI applications
